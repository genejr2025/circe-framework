## What Happens When You Start CIRCE

When you issue the startup command, the agent will:

1. **Load Context**
   - Read /data/Repos/CLAUDE.md (Master Orchestrator)
   - Read /data/Repos/docs/circe-framework/ (All CIRCE docs)
   - Check agent roles and hierarchy

2. **System Check**
   - Review active todos
   - Check for pending documentation
   - Verify agent configurations

3. **Role Activation**
   - Activate specified role (SCRIBE, EAGLE, etc.)
   - Load role-specific protocols
   - Set appropriate permissions/constraints

4. **Status Report**
   - Report system health
   - List active agents
   - Show pending tasks
   - Await your orders

## Quick Commands (After CIRCE is Started)

### Status Commands
- `CIRCE STATUS` - Full system status report
- `AGENT STATUS [agent_id]` - Specific agent status
- `DOCS STATUS` - Documentation status and coverage
- `TODO REVIEW` - Show all pending tasks

### Operation Commands
- `SCRIBE MODE` - Switch to documentation/design role
- `EAGLE MODE` - Switch to watchdog/audit role
- `ORCHESTRATE [task]` - Coordinate multi-agent work
- `EMERGENCY [issue]` - Emergency response mode

### Documentation Commands
- `DOCUMENT [topic]` - Create/update documentation
- `REVIEW [doc]` - Audit existing documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE [system]` - Design/review architecture
- `CHANGELOG` - Review recent changes

## Daily Operational Template

```
CIRCE INITIALIZATION - ROOSTER COMMAND
Date: [Today's date]
Session: Daily Operations
Role: SCRIBE

Morning Checklist:
1. System status check
2. Review overnight changes
3. Process pending todos
4. Update documentation
5. Plan today's work

Status: Ready for orders
```

## Session Memory Context

To maintain session continuity, always include:
- Current phase of project
- Recent decisions made
- Active work streams
- Pending approvals

Example:
```
CIRCE INITIALIZATION - ROOSTER COMMAND
Role: SCRIBE
Context: Working on master_circe_agent design (Phase 1)
Recent: Created directory structures, awaiting approval on digital twin architecture
Active: CIRCE Framework documentation, agent role definitions
Pending: ROOSTER approval on EAGLE watchdog design

Ready to proceed.
```

## Emergency Protocols

### System Down
```
EMERGENCY - CIRCE DOWN
Immediate diagnostics required
Check: Redis, Postgres, all agents
Report: What's offline and why
Action: Recovery steps
```

### Agent Failure
```
EMERGENCY - AGENT FAILURE
Agent: [agent_id]
Symptoms: [what's wrong]
Impact: [what's affected]
Action: Isolate and recover
```

### Data Loss Risk
```
EMERGENCY - DATA INTEGRITY
Risk: [describe risk]
Affected: [what's at risk]
Immediate: Backup and secure
Then: Root cause analysis
```

## Notes for ROOSTER

- **Keep it simple**: Just say "Start CIRCE" and specify your role
- **Context is key**: Brief description helps me load right mindset
- **Session continuity**: Reference recent work to maintain flow
- **Trust the protocol**: I'll handle the initialization sequence

**Simplest Command**:
```
Start CIRCE as SCRIBE - continue our work on [whatever we're doing]
```

**ROOSTER OUT** - Agent awaits your command.
